-Java io package has so many class to fulfill what we need to do with the file or need
 to perform input and output.
-It support many data such as primitives , object , localized character etc

- Now the question is what is stream?
 >so stream is sequence of data .
 >then there are two type of stream they are InputStream  and OutputStream.
 >Inputstream-it is used to read data from a source.
 >outputStream-it is used to write data to the destination.

-Type of Stream
 Byte Streams:-
 >java byte stream are used to perform input and output of 8-bit byte.
 >important one are FileInputStream and FileOutputStream
 
 Character Streams:-
 >java character stream are used to perform input and output for 16-bite
  unicode.
 >important one are FileReader and FileWriter
 >internally it used the FileInputStream and FileOutputStream but major
  difference that they read and write 2 byte at a time.
 
 Standard Stream 
 >Standard Input -keyboard typing, is represented by System.in
 >Standard Output - this is to output the data to the computer screen represented as System.out
 >Standard Error- this is to output the error data produced by the user program to the computer screen,represented as
 System.err
 >for reading the standard input stream we use InputStreamReader constructor passing the System.in
 
-Object
	-InputStream
		>FileInputStream
		>ByteArrayInputStream-allow buffer in the memory to be used as input stream
		>FilterInputStream
			-BufferedInputStream
			-DataInputStream
		>ObjectInputStream
	-OutputStream
		>FileOutputStream-will create a file if it is not present before opening it for the output
		>ByteArrayOutputStream-create a buffer in the memory all the data in the stream is stored in buffer.
		>FilterOutputStream
			-BufferedOutputStream
			-DataOutputStream
		>ObjectOutputStream
